# üöÄ MILESTONE 7: MARKET-READY POLISH & ESSENTIAL FIXES

**Goal**: Get core product to market with essential improvements only - NO SCOPE CREEP
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks
**Priority**: Launch-critical features only

---

## üéØ **PM CORE REQUIREMENTS - LAUNCH BLOCKERS ONLY**

Based on PM feedback, focus ONLY on these 6 essential items to get to market:

### **1. STREAMING BUSINESS NAMES** üî• **CRITICAL**
**Requirement**: "I would like to see the names appearing one by one, it would be pretty cool to see all the businesses names I am about to get phone number of as a user!"

**Implementation**:
- Show business names appearing progressively during search
- Simple text-based streaming (not complex terminal UI)
- Update search progress: "Found: Business Name 1... Business Name 2..."

### **2. USER PROFILE INTEGRATION** üî• **CRITICAL** 
**Requirement**: "Yes, I want the dashboard to say something like 'Ready for leads, {first name}?'"

**Implementation**:
- Extract first name from Google OAuth user data
- Update dashboard header from "Welcome back! üëã" to "Ready for leads, {firstName}?"
- Add user profile picture to header (optional enhancement)

### **3. VISUAL CONSISTENCY** üî• **CRITICAL**
**Requirement**: "Yes, this is paramount, the whole platform should be coherent in visuals and UI"

**Implementation**:
- Apply mint green theme consistently across dashboard
- Match landing page's professional design feel
- Update buttons, accents, and color scheme to mint green
- Maintain current functionality, just improve styling

### **4. API LIMITS CORRECTION** üî• **CRITICAL**
**Requirement**: "The api key limits are for 10'000 api call a month, so that should be the measure we show users, instead of 1000 a day!"

**Implementation**:
- Update usage tracking from daily (1000/day) to monthly (10,000/month)
- Fix both frontend display and backend logic
- Update progress bars and usage statistics

### **5. DUPLICATE PREVENTION** üî• **CRITICAL**
**Requirement**: "We should think of a strategy to avoid scraping the same leads multiple times if someone calls the search on the same business type on the same city"

**Implementation**:
- Simple cache mechanism to track searched combinations
- Store: city + business type + lead place_id combinations
- Skip already-found leads in subsequent searches
- Clear cache after reasonable time period (7-30 days)

### **6. CUSTOM LEAD COUNT** üî• **CRITICAL**
**Requirement**: "We should allow users to decide how many leads they want to get from a city without setting predefined options like {10-25-50}"

**Implementation**:
- Replace dropdown with number input field
- Allow any number (with reasonable max limit)
- Show warning: "Results may vary based on city size and population"
- Set reasonable bounds (min: 5, max: 100 per search)

---

## üö´ **EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED - NO SCOPE CREEP**

**PM Statement**: "Everything else is extra in my opinion and should be avoided to stay in scope and budget!"

### **Features to AVOID:**
- ‚ùå Advanced search filters (rating, phone availability)
- ‚ùå Sort/filter results tables  
- ‚ùå Search history or saved searches
- ‚ùå Enhanced export options (column selection, multiple formats)
- ‚ùå Usage analytics and insights
- ‚ùå Notification systems
- ‚ùå Complex streaming terminal UI
- ‚ùå Performance optimizations beyond basic needs
- ‚ùå Mobile responsiveness (focus on desktop)
- ‚ùå Collaboration features
