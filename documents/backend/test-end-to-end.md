# 🧪 End-to-End Testing Checklist

## Current Status: INCOMPLETE AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM

### ❌ **Critical Issues Found**

1. **No Persistent Authentication**
   - Tokens stored in React state (memory only)
   - Page refresh = logout
   - No localStorage/cookie session management

2. **Token Management Disconnect**
   - AuthContext stores token in state
   - LeadService looks for token in localStorage
   - These don't communicate

### 🔍 **Tests That Need To Be Run**

#### Authentication Flow
- [ ] User can login via Google OAuth
- [ ] Token is received and stored
- [ ] Dashboard loads with authenticated state
- [ ] Page refresh maintains authentication ❌ **FAILS**
- [ ] API calls work with stored token ❌ **FAILS**

#### API Key Management  
- [ ] User can access Settings page
- [ ] User can enter API key
- [ ] API key saves to database
- [ ] API key shows as configured in dashboard
- [ ] API key persists after page refresh

#### Lead Generation
- [ ] Business types load in dropdown
- [ ] Search form accepts input
- [ ] Search makes authenticated API call
- [ ] Results display correctly
- [ ] CSV export works

### 🚨 **Production Blockers**

1. **Session Management**: Must implement persistent auth
2. **Token Consistency**: Must unify token storage/retrieval
3. **Database Integration**: Must verify API key storage works

### 🔧 **Required Fixes**

1. Implement localStorage token persistence
2. Update LeadService to use AuthContext token
3. Test full OAuth → Dashboard → API flow
4. Verify API key storage/retrieval
5. Test page refresh authentication

**Status**: ❌ NOT PRODUCTION READY
**Estimated Fix Time**: 4-6 hours for core auth issues
