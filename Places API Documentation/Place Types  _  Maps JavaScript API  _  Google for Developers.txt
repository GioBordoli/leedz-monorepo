Place Types
Select platform:

Android (/maps/documentation/places/android-sdk/place-types)

iOS (/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/place-types)
JavaScript (/maps/documentation/javascript/place-types)
Web Service (/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-types)

Place types are categories that identify the characteristics of a place. A place can have one or more
place types assigned to it.
A place's types are included in the response from a Place Details (New), Nearby Search (New), Text
Search (New), and Autocomplete (New) request:
A place can have a single primary type from type Table A (#table-a) or type Table B (#table-b)
associated with it. For example, the primary type might be mexican_restaurant or

steak_house.The primary type may be missing if the place's primary type is not a supported
type. When a primary type is present, it is always one of the types in the types field.
A place can have multiple type values from type Table A (#table-a) or type Table B (#table-b)
associated with it. For example a restaurant might have the following types:

seafood_restaurant, restaurant, food, point_of_interest, establishment.
The address and address components of a place can be tagged with certain types from the
Address types and address component types (#address-types) table. For example, an address
might be tagged as an street_address and a component of the address might be tagged as a

street_number.
You can also specify place types as part of a request. When specified in the request, the type acts as
a filter to restrict the response to only include places that match the specified types.

About the type tables
Table A (#table-a) lists the supported values for place types:
As part of a response from Place Details (New), Nearby Search (New), and Text Search (New).
The values in Table A are then used to populate those fields.
As part of a Nearby Search (New) request, used as the value of the includedTypes,

excludedTypes, includedPrimaryTypes, and excludedPrimaryTypes parameter. The values
in Table B are then used to populate those fields.
As part of a Text Search (New) request, used as the value of the includedType parameter.
As part of a Place Autocomplete Widget (New) request, use as the values to the

includedPrimaryTypes parameter.
As part of a Place Autocomplete Widget (New) response.
Table B (#table-b) lists additional place type values which may also be returned as part of a Place
Details (New), Nearby Search (New), Text Search (New), and Place Autocomplete Widget (New)
response. The request must specify at least one of the places.types or places.primaryType
fields in the field mask. Values from Table B may NOT be used as part of a request, except as the
values to the includedPrimaryTypes parameter for a Place Autocomplete Widget (New) request.
Address types and address component types (#address-types) list types that may appear in either or
both address type and address component type arrays in the response body. Address component
types are subject to change.

Address types and address component types
The types array in the response indicates the address type. Examples of address types include a
street address, a country, or a political entity. The types array in the

google.maps.places.AddressComponent class indicates the type of each part of the address.
Examples include street number or country.
Addresses may have multiple types. The types may be considered 'tags'. For example, many cities
are tagged with the political and locality types.
The following types are supported and returned in both the address type and address component
type arrays:
