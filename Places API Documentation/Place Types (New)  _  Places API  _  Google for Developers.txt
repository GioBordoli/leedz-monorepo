Introduction
Place types are categories that identify the characteristics of a place. A place can have one or more
place types assigned to it.
A place's types are included in the response from a Place Details (New), Nearby Search (New), Text
Search (New), and Autocomplete (New) request:
A place can have a single primary type from type Table A (#table-a) or type Table B (#table-b)
associated with it. For example, the primary type might be mexican_restaurant or

steak_house.The primary type may be missing if the place's primary type is not a supported
type. When a primary type is present, it is always one of the types in the types field.
A place can have multiple type values from type Table A (#table-a) or type Table B (#table-b)
associated with it. For example a restaurant might have the following types:

seafood_restaurant, restaurant, food, point_of_interest, establishment.
The address and address components of a place can be tagged with certain types from the
Address types and address component types (#address-types) table. For example, an address
might be tagged as an street_address and a component of the address might be tagged as a

street_number.
You can also specify place types as part of a request. When specified in the request, the type acts as
a filter to restrict the response to only include places that match the specified types.

About the type tables
Table A (#table-a) lists the types that are used in the following ways:
As part of a response from Place Details (New), Nearby Search (New), and Text Search (New).
The request must specify at least one of the places.types or places.primaryType fields in
the field mask. The values in Table A are then used to populate those fields.
As part of a Nearby Search (New) request, used as the value of the includedTypes,

excludedTypes, includedPrimaryTypes, and excludedPrimaryTypes parameter. The values
in Table B are then used to populate those fields.
As part of a Text Search (New) request, used as the value of the includedType parameter.
As part of a Autocomplete (New) request, use as the values to the includedPrimaryTypes
parameter.
As part of a Autocomplete (New) response.
Table B (#table-b) lists additional place type values which may also be returned as part of a Place
Details (New), Nearby Search (New), Text Search (New), and Autocomplete (New) response. The
request must specify at least one of the places.types or places.primaryType fields in the field
mask. Values from Table B may NOT be used as part of a request, except as the values to the

includedPrimaryTypes parameter for a Autocomplete (New) request.
Address types and address component types (#address-types) list types that may appear in either or
both address type and address component type arrays in the response body. Address component
types are subject to change.

Address types and address component types
The types array in the response indicates the address type. Examples of address types include a
street address, a country, or a political entity. The types array in the AddressComponent field
indicates the type of each part of the address. Examples include street number or country.
Addresses may have multiple types. The types may be considered 'tags'. For example, many cities
are tagged with the political and locality types.
The following types are supported and returned in both the address type and address component
type arrays:

route

The national political entity, and is typically the highest order type returned by
the Geocoder.

administrative_area_level_1A first-order civil entity below the country level. Within the United States, these
administrative levels are states. Not all nations exhibit these administrative

levels. In most cases, administrative_area_level_1 short names will
closely match ISO 3166-2 subdivisions and other widely circulated lists;
however this is not guaranteed as our geocoding results are based on a
variety of signals and location data.

these administrative levels are counties. Not all nations exhibit these
administrative levels.

administrative_area_level_3A third-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor
civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.

administrative_area_level_4A fourth-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor
civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.
